Cleaned and pre-processed a real estate dataset by handling missing values, extracting and converting features, and removing outliers. Engineered new features like price-per-square-foot, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applied outlier detection techniques based on location-specific statistics. Built a Linear Regression model using the California Housing dataset, evaluated its performance with cross-validation, and achieved reliable price predictions with an R-squared score on the test set.
